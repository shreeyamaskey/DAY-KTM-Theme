    <!-- A Brief History -->
    <div class="day-history">
        <h1>A Brief History</h1>
        <p>Dear Asian Youth was founded in May of 2020 by Stephanie Hu, a 16-year-old who wished to create a platform to publish her poetry. It evolved into a blog dedicated to the Asian narrative, then a literary magazine, then a full-fledged organization with over 100 members on the national team in the US. Functioning remotely, the organization today is the result of passionate volunteers with a shared purpose.</p>
